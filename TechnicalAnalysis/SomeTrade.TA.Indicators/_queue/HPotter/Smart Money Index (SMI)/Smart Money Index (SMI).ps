// Attention:
// If you would to use this indicator on the ES, you should have intraday data 60min in your account.
//
// Smart money index (SMI) or smart money flow index is a technical analysis indicator demonstrating investors sentiment. 
// The index was invented and popularized by money manager Don Hays.[1] The indicator is based on intra-day price patterns.
// The main idea is that the majority of traders (emotional, news-driven) overreact at the beginning of the trading day 
// because of the overnight news and economic data. There is also a lot of buying on market orders and short covering at the opening. 
// Smart, experienced investors start trading closer to the end of the day having the opportunity to evaluate market performance.
// Therefore, the basic strategy is to bet against the morning price trend and bet with the evening price trend. The SMI may be calculated 
// for many markets and market indices (S&P 500, DJIA, etc.)
//
// The SMI sends no clear signal whether the market is bullish or bearish. There are also no fixed absolute or relative readings signaling 
// about the trend. Traders need to look at the SMI dynamics relative to that of the market. If, for example, SMI rises sharply when the 
// market falls, this fact would mean that smart money is buying, and the market is to revert to an uptrend soon. The opposite situation 
// is also true. A rapidly falling SMI during a bullish market means that smart money is selling and that market is to revert to a downtrend 
// soon. The SMI is, therefore, a trend-based indicator.
// Some analysts use the smart money index to claim that precious metals such as gold will continually maintain value in the future.
