// This indicator plots Dynamic Momentum Index indicator. The Dynamic Momentum 
// Index (DMI) was developed by Tushar Chande and Stanley Kroll. The indicator 
// is covered in detail in their book The New Technical Trader.
// The DMI is identical to Welles Wilder`s Relative Strength Index except the 
// number of periods is variable rather than fixed. The variability of the time 
// periods used in the DMI is controlled by the recent volatility of prices. 
// The more volatile the prices, the more sensitive the DMI is to price changes. 
// In other words, the DMI will use more time periods during quiet markets, and 
// less during active markets. The maximum time periods the DMI can reach is 30 
// and the minimum is 3. This calculation method is similar to the Variable 
// Moving Average, also developed by Tushar Chande.
// The advantage of using a variable length time period when calculating the RSI 
// is that it overcomes the negative effects of smoothing, which often obscure short-term moves.
// The volatility index used in controlling the time periods in the DMI is based 
// on a calculation using a five period standard deviation and a ten period average 
// of the standard deviation.
