// The Klinger Oscillator (KO) was developed by Stephen J. Klinger. Learning 
// from prior research on volume by such well-known technicians as Joseph Granville, 
// Larry Williams, and Marc Chaikin, Mr. Klinger set out to develop a volume-based 
// indicator to help in both short- and long-term analysis.
// The KO was developed with two seemingly opposite goals in mind: to be sensitive 
// enough to signal short-term tops and bottoms, yet accurate enough to reflect the 
// long-term flow of money into and out of a security.
// The KO is based on the following tenets:
// Price range (i.e. High - Low) is a measure of movement and volume is the force behind 
// the movement. The sum of High + Low + Close defines a trend. Accumulation occurs when 
// today's sum is greater than the previous day's. Conversely, distribution occurs when 
// today's sum is less than the previous day's. When the sums are equal, the existing trend 
// is maintained.
// Volume produces continuous intra-day changes in price reflecting buying and selling pressure. 
// The KO quantifies the difference between the number of shares being accumulated and distributed 
// each day as "volume force". A strong, rising volume force should accompany an uptrend and then 
// gradually contract over time during the latter stages of the uptrend and the early stages of 
// the following downtrend. This should be followed by a rising volume force reflecting some 
// accumulation before a bottom develops.
