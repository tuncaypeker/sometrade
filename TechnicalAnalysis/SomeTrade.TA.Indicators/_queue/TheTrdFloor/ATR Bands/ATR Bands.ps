// In many strategies, it's quite common to use a scaled ATR to help define a stop-loss, and it's not uncommon to use it for take-profit targets
// as well.  While there are quite a few indicators that plot ATR bands already on TV, we could not find one that actually performed the exact 
// way that we wanted.  They all had at least one of the following gaps:
//   * The ATR offset was not configurable (usually hard-coded to be based off the high or low, while we generally prefer to use close)
//   * It would only print a single band (either the upper or lower), which would require the same indicator to be added twice
//   * The ATR scaling factor was either not configurable or only stepped in whole numbers (often time fractional factors like 1.5 yield better results)
//
// Also, when looking at some of the behaviors of the ATR bands, you can see that when price first levels out, you can draw a "consolidation zone" from
// the first peak of the upper ATR band to the first valley of the lower ATR band and look for price to break and close outside of that zone.  When that
// happens, price will usually make a notable move in that direction.
//
// While we have made some updates and enhancements to this indicator, and have every intention of continuing to do so as we find worthy opportunities
// for enhancement, credit is still due to the origianl author:  AlexanderTeaH
