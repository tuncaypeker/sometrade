// The Accelerator Oscillator has been developed by Bill Williams 
// as the development of the Awesome Oscillator. It represents the 
// difference between the Awesome Oscillator and the 5-period moving 
// average, and as such it shows the speed of change of the Awesome 
// Oscillator, which can be useful to find trend reversals before the 
// Awesome Oscillator does.
